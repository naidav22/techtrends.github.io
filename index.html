<article id="Quantum Computing">
<h2 class="heading">Quantum Computing</h2>
<p class="headingTwo">  What is Quantum Computing? </p>
<p class="paragraph">Quantum computing, unlike classical computing, is built on Qubits rather than bits. While bits can store a value of one or zero, 
qubits can store both in any combination simultaneously – this is called a “superposition.” A single calculation leads to a single path in classical computing, but quantum computing 
can explore a massive number of different paths at the same time due to the volatility of the qubit. </p>

<p class="headingTwo">  What are the benefits to society from Quantum Computing? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Quantum Computers can solve problems significantly faster than classical computers. In 2019, Google announced that a 
quantum computer solved a problem in 200 seconds (about 3 and a half minutes) that would take a normal computer 10, 000 years. The vast number of solutions it can come up with can make it easier
 to develop models of molecules in the human body, accelerate the training of AI system, and do prime factorization. This can help the pharmaceutical companies develop drugs, help the automotive companies
 teach self-driving cars how to make decisions in crucial moments, and factorize large prime numbers that businesses use as the basis for their encryption efforts.</p>

<p class="headingTwo">  What are the Concerns with Quantum Computing? </p>
<p class="paragraph">One of the main concerns with quantum computing is cybersecurity, especially in the event of large-scale quantum adoption. This means in the geopolitical space whoever gets their first has a huge advantage. </p>

<article id="Electric Vehicles">
<h2 class="heading">Electric Vehicles</h2>
<p class="headingTwo">  What are Electric Vehicles? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Electric vehicles are automobiles that are powered by an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The electric motor is run by 
a large onboard battery pack that is charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. Electric vehicles produce no direct exhaust emissions, which makes them more environmentally
 friendly than gas-powered cars. Major automakers are developing and releasing new electric vehicle models as the technology continues to evolve. </p>

<p class="headingTwo">  What are the benefits to society from Electric Vehicles? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Electric vehicles can reduce air pollution, especially in urban areas, because they produce no direct exhaust emissions. Widespread adoption of
 electric vehicles could reduce dependence on fossil fuels like gasoline, benefiting energy security and sustainability. The technology innovation spurred by electric vehicles also stands to
 create new jobs and industries around enhanced batteries, power electronics, and charging infrastructure. </p>

<p class="headingTwo">  What are the Concerns with Electric Vehicles? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Limited driving range and long charging times make electric vehicles impractical for many consumers accustomed to the convenience of gas vehicles. 
The upfront cost of purchasing an electric vehicle is still much higher than comparable gas-powered models, even with incentives. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles will require massive 
investment in charging infrastructure and upgrades to electric grids to handle the increased power demand. </p>

<p class="headingTwo">  What components of technology are required for Electric Vehicles? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Electric vehicles require high-capacity battery packs to store and deliver electric power, electric motors instead of internal combustion engines 
to propel the wheels, power electronics to operate the electric systems, and charging ports to connect the battery to an electricity source for recharging. Sophisticated software and computing
 power are also needed to monitor and efficiently manage the battery, power delivery, and drivetrain components. </p>

<p class="headingTwo"> What are some careers related to Electric Vehicles? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Some careers related to electric vehicles include electrical engineers, battery researchers, software developers, manufacturing technicians, policy analysts, and charging infrastructure builders. </p>
